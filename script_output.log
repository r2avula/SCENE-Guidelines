To do so, first it builds a hypothesis around a steady state behaviour. Second, it esecutes random actions against the targeted cloud system and run experimetns automatically in production while controlling the risk of system failure by reducing the blast radius. The experimetns are monitored and analysed to collect observations and detect vulnerabilities. The acuired knowledge is then used to hardening the security measure and in preparing the subsequent fault injection campaigns. All the observations, falut models, security best practices, and sure baselines are stored in a knowledge base. | Attack graphs: GraphViz (SW), Dot (SW), Terraform (SW).

They adopted the cloud testing methodology proposed by the CSA's Cloud Penetration Testing Play book. The experiments  are focused on IAM (users, policies) and cloud storage service (S3 buckets, configurations). Fifty user accounts are provisioned on AWS and GCP cloud infrastructure, 25 users per cloud. Each user account is properly configured using privilege separation concepts. The evaluation targeted two aspects: (1) Time Perfromance: this experiment aims at evaluating the performance of CloudStrike w.r.t time overhead while injecting security faults (workloads), (2) recovery operations: CloudStrike performs recovery operations on completion of security fault injection campaigns. So this experimet aims to evaluate the impact of these operations to gain insights of the overhead of recovery, (3) CPU and memory consumptions, and (4) security evaluation: to evalaute Cloudstrike from a security perspective i.e., whehter CloudStrike proves security hypotheses and provide guidance on appropriate security countermeasures.

Considering AWS: Low takes 38 seconds, medium takes 58 Seconds, and high takes 75 seconds. Recovery operations: these operations requires more API calls than those required by fault injection since this operation executes global checks for all assets using the state transition analysis technique and expected-state. CPU consumption is less than 10 %. The GCP API has a higher overhead due to reauthentication and more complex HTTP requests/responses, hence more CPU is utilized. Memory consumptions ranges from 28MB to 175MB max corresponding to the rise of attack rates. Regarding the effect of Cloudstrike on security, out of 10 executed attacks, only one detection captured the hypotheses tested via the fault injection campaigns.  Specifically, the only hypothesis proven right was Alarms will be triggered if S3 bucket policies are altered.

The architecture of the chaos engineering service consists of multiple components in an MVC pattern. An important part of the service is a message broker that performs tasks in regular intervals. These tasks include obtaining information of all VMs and experimental parameters from the users, It also retrieves the experiment results from the DB. The DB publishes parameters for the chaos engineering experiments and to create a queue for the system components to be executed.

Cons: existence of possible wrong answers from the LLM. The LLM may not understand the contextof the questions and tend to generate meaningless answers. Cons: there is another limitation regardingthe use of LLMs, which is related to the specific dataset usedfor training because it can introduce different forms of biasin the output. Lesson: it is vital to underline the importance of the consultant (security anallyst)’s experience in filtering answers provided to the LLM and provide a proper context. Lesson: ChatGPT-4 could not only inferattacks, but also query websites with attack procedures, which substantially improved the realism of attack-defensetrees.

The execution of the attack behind the first experiment involves four key actions: i) establishing a secure tunnel to the attacker’s machine, ii) creating a repository to store the reverse shell command, iii) initiating aCodePipeline project, and iv) attempting to extract credentials. The second experiment aims to validatewhether static code analysis_x000D_tools integrated into a continuous integration pipeline (CI)_x000D_can identify vulnerabilities in source code implemented by_x000D_developers. The execution of this attack is composed of 4 actions:_x000D_i) Creating a CI pipeline, ii) Integrating AWS CodeGuru_x000D_Security, iii) Implanting a vulnerability , and iv)Analyzing_x000D_ CodeGuru Security results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                        |

These experiments include terminating ActiveMQ , ActiveMQ single queue multi-message flooding, ActiveMQ multi-queue single message flooding, terminating WorldWind, and injecting corrupted NavService. For the first three experiments, they run each experiment (using single virtual machine) for 15 minutes, then they switch to the second, and third respectively. They run the fourth and fifth experiment separately (among two virtual machines) due the requirement of NavService and WorldWind. They evaluate the performance of testbed by measuring the CPU load and RAM Usage of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Quantitatite: CPU load and Memory usage of the system._x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  CPU Load: average between 0 and 30%.

Lesson Learned: many system details at the functional level cannot be observed using monitoring tools or chaos logs, for example, determining if a service is receiving erroneous data or if a service is stuck in a certain state due to a functional error. Lesson Learned: One of the main challenges while using CE for evaluating SHS is to control the cascading effects of chaos experiments. For a systematic and thorough evaluation, it is vital to avoid superfluous failures. However, limiting the blast radius to the set of relevant components requires an in-depth understanding of system functionalities and dependencies. The following measures can help to improve a system’s capacity to limit the blast radius: 1) Context-awareness can support effective decision-making and enable more effective evaluations of SHS. 2) Priority-awareness of involved tasks can help with addressing the most critical failures first, resulting in a more optimal flow of resolving failures. This is especially important in case of multiple failures and can help prevent cascading failures, thereby minimizing the blast radius. 3) Conditional monitoring allows one to dig deeper into error-prone areas while keeping the monitoring overhead under control, aiding in fault identification and diagnosis._x000D_ |          nan           |
